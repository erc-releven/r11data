Question them in private; for there are some people who are not naturally inclined to speak freely, but have something important to say, and don’t dare to.",

Even if, perhaps, he had another route by which he could get out in good order, yet, from bad planning, or rather from inexperience, he was caught. lxxii But have skilful spies and communications-men, and before you enter, let them reconnoitre the routes; and once you go in and make your raid, leave by another route, and you will have no worries. And if there is no other route, go in suddenly, without warning, and when you have raided, return quickly by the way you came in. But, if so, when you go in to raid, leave men to hold the passes and the peaks of the mountains, and brave, skilful men in charge of them; and when you have raided, you will return, with God's help, without worries, rejoicing and happy.",

For it’s not even possible for anyone to get up there unless by one narrow road, and then to enter first through the gate of the fortress - and that with considerable difficulty. So there was nothing safer than this stronghold. The toparch of Tobion, who was also my pappos, was longing to get possession of it. So what does he think up? By many gifts he makes a friend of the general in command of this fortress, having declared to him that, whatever he needed, he should boldly send and get from him. So the general was enchanted by all this; he happened to come in need of corn, and then informed the toparch, who said, cheerfully: ‘As much as you demand’. He sends him a thousand animals carrying corn; a man followed each pair of donkeys, as if indeed to take care of them. The general reckoned: ‘If my fortress is victualled by the very enemy of Romania, what do I deserve?’ Then, when the corn arrives, he cheerfully opens the gates for the animals and the men attending them to come in.  But the men were armed for fighting, and had their swords, hidden. As soon as they came in they wrenched open the gates; they kill the spearmen and take possession of the fortress. And so a friendship becomes a cause of misfortune, and deserves to be remembered. So you should protect yourself from your friends more than from your enemies. If the general had not trusted those he thought were his friends but had ordered them to unload the corn outside the gate, he would have benefited from them, and their cunning would have come to nothing, and the general would have had no worries.",

This general wanted to gain a victory by simulated friendship. In the fortresses of Dalmatia, at Zenta and at Stamnus, there was a toparch, Boisthlabus of Diokleia; and (the general) wanted to capture him. And what does he do? He makes friends with him, frequently sending him presents, intending to deceive him with them.  But he, even if he was a foreigner, did however have the wisdom of nature, and that which comes from experience; he took the gifts, and pretended, also, to be the Emperor’s humble subject, as if, indeed, because of the generosity and kindness of the general. Since, too, the toparch had a new-born child, the general declared that he would receive him from Holy Baptism. (The toparch) said, cheerfully: ‘And, if you request it, come to my house, too’; but the general didn’t want to. So they both decided that they would perform their baptismal alliance between the general’s theme and the toparch’s territory. The general had warships ready, at sea - for the place was by the sea - so that when he should give a sign, they should capture (the toparch), and throw him into the ship. The toparch had the same plan, too, and had valiant men ready in hiding, so that, when he should make the signal which he had appointed for them, they should spring out and capture the general and the people with him; which is what happened. Then they met, and, after greeting one another, sat down. As they sat down, the signal was given, and they surrounded the general and bound him hand and foot and led  him captive with his son, as well, and all the people with him, and the ships, to Stamnos. And he was caught in the snares and nets in which he had intended to make his catch, to the shame of the Romans.",

This man was toparch of the Bulgarians; and, having got possession of the city, he sent to it an old soldier, experienced in warfare - now a general in the Bulgarian language is called a Tzelnik - Lytoboes of Diabolis,having given him troops as well for protecting the fortress. He went off, and rebuilt the walls, which had been neglected, and made mangonels and such machines as it is feasible for a general to make. When he had strengthened the fortress, he put care aside, as he did not fear any attack from without, nor suspect any plot from within, since the inhabitants were very simple and entirely inexperienced, and since he had also secured them by an oath. Now carelessness tends to bring sorrows and dangers all of a sudden. So the general stopped caring about these things, and had no suspicion of the people inside the city, but gave his attention to luxury and relaxation. But, even if the inhabitants were inexperienced, yet it is nature who teaches all contrivance and cunning; they send secretly to the Dux of Thessalonike, for him to send someone to take the fortress and reward them. The Dux sends them a certain Pantheote, called Zepe, with ships and troops. When the ships have been brought to land in a hidden place near the harbour, this news is brought secretly to the inhabitants; and they indeed went straight out, and captured the general, bound him and the guards with him, and handed them over to the Romans.",

Her uncle, partly because it was ancient, partly, too, because it was valuable, and also because it belonged to his niece, spared it, and didn’t destroy it, not having the slightest suspicion about it. The Franks, having laboured hard to take Otranto in battle were not able to. So what does their Count think up?

She was carried away by her desire, and agreed, and did it; and by night she hoisted over the wall witha rope some of the Franks, their most intelligent and excellent men, who, during the following night, bored a hole in the wall of the fortress and brought in the Franks, a large force. Then, before dawn, with shouts, they attacked the men in the city. When they saw the enemy unexpectedly inside the fortress, they rushed to escape; for when evil attacks suddenly it destroys even the very bravest and most reasonable. Anyway, Malapezza, who was taking care of the fortress, immediately ran away and got into a boat alone and was rescued in a disgraceful and remorse-bringing way; he left his wife and children in the hands of the enemy.

For when a man runs into something of which he has no experience, if it’s good it makes him plunge into excessive delight and rude overconfidence; but if it’s something bad or frightening it fills him with consternation, while his mind conjures up fantasies. So when both sides had given their word by oath, they felt no more concern. There was a man there, a Byzantine by origin, but living in Demetrias, and extremely deceitful; Noah was the name of the man I’ve mentioned. He tried every device to remove the inhabitants’ money and possessions and make them his own. So this man, who happened to be in power in Demetrias at that time, and wanted to make some profit out of the Saracens as well, didn’t allow them to go far from the fortress and hold the market, but made them do their selling up against the wall. The trick he had in mind was that, if the selling took place far away from the fortress, he couldn’t go out and see what they were selling; but, if it took place up against the wall, he could see from the tower what attracted him, and have it brought up as if he were going to buy it - and when the evening came, they would have got nothing and go away empty-handed. So they did a little business, and then, when heavy rain fell, they pretended they were embarking on their ships. The people of the city descended from the walls and went into their houses because of the rain, leaving a few guards, and even they were careless, through inexperience. The Hagarenes, without delaying, made an attempt (on the city), casting ashore five armed men from each of their five ships. They came across from the side of the fortress where the inhabitants had no suspicion, and got up on to the bastions of the fortress by the buildings and the tiled roofs adjoining the wall, and straight away, without a fight, took this strong city, abounding with all good things.",

He was very rich and well-born, and the leading man in the region. Robert the Frank, having, by God’s permission, become tyrant, was eager to capture him; so he tried every device and was repelled. So what does he do? He goes as a friend outside the city and tells him to come outside the gate, as if indeed for some important and secret matter. Teras goes out of the gate of the fortress, but (stays) inside the moat. So the Frank pretended to be frighened of the men who came out with Teras. Then Teras told them to withdraw, and when he had been left on his own they both stood in conversation. The Frank had three chosen men ready, mounted on valuable horses, who spurred down, jumped over the moat, seized him and turned back with him immediately, and captured that wonderful man like a slave. As for the tortures which they inflicted on him, I am not capable of describing them. So guard against the schemes of your enemies and don’t trust them.",

I give the same advice to soldiers, too; I never saw an effortful and vigilant man who did not enjoy extreme prosperity. For work is never wasted. Not everyone follows the straight road, but (some) turn aside to crimes, snatching not only food and drink but even ornaments and clothes.

But I have remembered one subject towards which I shall direct my advice. It is good that you should always observe your daughter and your wife very carefully. There is a man, distinguished and rich,  a dignitary, and very well-born, owning fine residences in the City - I am leaving out his name intentionally, for he’s still alive. This man has a well-born wife, whose brother is a general; she is beautiful to look at, and was then even more beautiful in soul, adorned with understanding and virtue, and instructed in the Holy Scriptures, too. The Emperor, having often heard about her, sent people to her, in his desire to have an affair with her, promising dignities and many other benefits for her and for her husband; her husband didn’t know of it. Then the Emperor sends him off as judge of a theme; but when he couldn’t persuade her,  he became silent. After three years her husband came back from the theme, and was delighted with his own home. A good-looking and distinguished young man in the provinces pretended to be a relation of hers, and then speaks to her husband in the Palace: 'I', he says, 'am a relation of that lady there, the judge’s wife'. And, after saying much more to him, he makes friends with him, and the judge invites him (to his house); the young man deceives him and becomes his intimate. Why do I choose to speak at length? He has an affair with the woman - she who was once happy, now wretched. When this event became known, her husband and her relations were in the grip of dejection and grief, or rather disgrace, but the young man boasted about it as if about one of the labours of Hercules. What the Emperor, and promises of dignities and riches could not achieve, was done by intimacy and a friend.",

Look after him; only, don’t have him as a real friend. I know you can describe some people who, from great enmity, have been reconciled into great friendship. But this happens in several ways; a man’s enemy becomes silent either because he fears him, or because he needs his help, or deceiving him and intending to overthrow him, or because the aid that comes from on high checks him and, even if unwillingly, he is silent. Perhaps he really makes friends wholeheartedly; but this is rare, and in tens of thousands only one such (man) will be found. Observe my words; an old enemy does not become a new friend. If you are able to do good to your enemies, don't delay, but do good (to then).

Hear how it happens: the man who intends to borrow money in this way doesn’t ask for the loan at first, but he will send you some things to eat: hares, perhaps, or partridges, or fish, and other things and - for example - fragrant things. Then he will do this a second and third time, and also he will invite you (to his house), as though from affection for you, once, and even twice. Then he will show you a considerable quantity of gold - which he has borrowed from someone else - and will say to you: 'I got this ready for such-and-such a business transaction, but they don't want this coinage, but such-and-such a one' - which he knows that you have. 'I know', he says, 'that you have it, and, if you love me, give it to me, so that I don’t lose the (chance of this) transaction, since I am going to make a big profit; and tomorrow, or at the end of the week, you will get your own money, with large gifts as well'. If he doesn't say this, he’ll say something else, such as: 'I have this cash that you see on hand', and either, 'the key of the money-box has been lost', or else: 'yesterday', he will say, 'a friend of mine came, and I gave him so many pounds, and now I need them; give them to me. With me there's no chance that you’ll lose your money'. So, with these words, when he has drawn you, or rather softened you up, he will get a loan from you with plenty of goodwill, while you are remembering instead the foodstuffs that he sent you, and the expensive meals, and are hoping to get the same things again. But he, on getting the money, will consider your property as his profit, and 'Glory be', he will say, 'to the hares and the other things that I sent him. Blessings on the dinners that have brought me so such gold'. Little by little he will begin to keep his distance from you. You will send him notice to repay you, and he will give you words. Then he will try to hide from you as well. You will come early in the morning to his door, but he won’t even give you an answer and you will go away downcast. Even if you come in suddenly, and wish to speak with him, he will put something else forward as an excuse, pretending to be angry about something else, or to have some sorrow. If, under pressure, you say anything to him, he will say to you: 'Aren't you ashamed, putting pressure on me for those worthless, light-weight coins? Believe me, if I had known that you were that sort of person, I wouldn’t have got that money from you. For', he will say, 'I didn’t sell my merchandise'. And, adding some other convincing remarks, he will send you away empty-handed. After this he will say to you: 'Believe me, the foodstuffs I sent you, and the meals which you consumed, and the perfumes which you used as ointment and burned, cost a lot of money; why did I show you respect?' And he will even put that towards (defraying) the original sum. You will want to get something, even if only half, and it won’t be given to you, but he will criticise and slander you very much. Why do I speak at length? He will be a fierce enemy to you, breathing fire against you. These are the things that borrowers try with tricks; others employ adoptions as brothers, and baptismal alliances,  and provide sons- and daughters-in-law, and, making promises beyond their power (to fulfil), they attempt by every kind of trick to deprive you of your own property.

After a few years, when (my father) came to the City, and went off to greet him, he didn't find him in his house. (His cousin’s) valet took him and led him to St. Paul's, to the poorhouse, and he saw him sitting shut up in a dark room, (a place) they call the Stocks, weeping and abandoning his hold on life; for he had lost sixty pounds, and they demanded this amount from him.

If you enjoy a vessel, of gold perhaps, or silver, or glass, while you have it, consider that one gets lost, the other breaks, and, when this happens, don’t be thrown into confusion. Consider each thing in this way, and you won’t fall very seriously'.

Only, those who serve the Emperors, even if they speak in accordance with their wishes, are not upright, but deceit and injustice (are) in their mouth, and treachery lurks on their lips. For they wished that there should not be peace then, but that the earth should be defiled with the slaughter and blood of Christians. But my relation by marriage, even though he fell into this misfortune unexpectedly, prayed to God that he might be rescued from it, and might settle the business peacefully; and the good God pitied him, and, by His grace, he was able to settle everything that he wished peacefully. So, he took the oaths, and the holy icon - of our Christ and God, and the Mother of God, and many other saints, who were in the icon - (and) gave thanks to God, Who ordains peace; clxxxi he summoned the people, and brought out the icons, even in front of everyone, and showed them, and read out to them the oath as well, and advised them to be at peace, and each to go off to his own home. But they did not want to, but said: ‘You have stirred up war - don’t seek for peace’. When he opposed arguments for peace (to them), they did not agree; they uttered great cries, as an undisciplined crowd is bound to do. So he commanded that, from the Vlachs, their chosen leader, Sthlavotas Karmalakes, and, from the Larissans, Theodore Skribon Petastos, should be imprisoned. All the rest, when they saw these men being led away on the road to death, trembled, and fell down before him , and all asked him to forgive them, saying: ‘We will do whatever you command us’. So he was swayed by their appeals, and forgave them, and, taking the chiefs of the Vlachs and of the Larissans, he went off to the Katepan of Bulgaria, Andronikos Philokales, who sent him the Emperor’s oath. He found him cowering in Peteriskos, and fearing him very much; for he did not expect him to be speaking the truth about (making) peace. clxxxii.

Since the race of the Vlachs is entirely untrustworthy, and corrupt, and keeps true faith neither with God nor with the Emperor, nor with a relative or a friend, but endeavours to do down everyone, tells many lies and steals a great deal, swearing every day the most solemn oath to its friends, and violating them easily, performing adoptions of brothers and baptismal alliances, and scheming by these means to deceive simpler people, it has never yet kept faith with anyone, not even with the earlier emperors of the Romans. After being fought by the emperor Trajan, and entirely wiped out, they were captured, and their king, the so-called Dekabalos, was killed and his head was fastened on a spear in the middle of the city of the Romans. These are the so-called Dacians and Bessi They lived formerly near to the Danube river, and the Saos, the river which we now call the Sava, where Serbs live now, in secure and inaccessible places. Being confident in these (places), they pretended friendship and service to the earlier emperors of the Romans, and used to go out of their strongholds and plunder the lands of the Romans; as a result they were angered with them, and, as has been said, destroyed them. They left those parts, and were scattered throughout all Epirus and Macedonia, but most of them inhabited Hellas. They are very cowardly, with the hearts of hares, but with bravado - and even this comes from cowardice. So I advise you not to trust these people at all. And, if a revolt ever takes place, and they pretend friendship and trust, swearing by God to keep it, don’t trust them. It is better for you not to make them swear at all, nor to give them an oath, but to watch them, as evil men, rather than swearing or receiving an oath. So you mustn’t trust them at all; only, pretend yourself to be their friend. But, even if, sometime, an uprising takes place in Bulgaria, as has been said before, even if they profess to be your friends, or even swear, don’t trust them.clxxxviii. But, even if they bring their women and their children into the fortress belonging to Romania, encourage them to bring them, only let them be inside the citadel; let (the men) be outside. If they wish to go in to their households, let two or three go in; when they come out, you let others in turn come in. Pay great attention to the walls and to the gates. If you do so, you will be in safety. But, if you allow many to go in to their households, the fortress will be betrayed by them, and you will be bitten by them as if by an asp, and then you will remember my advice. But, if you observe this, you will have them as your subjects, and will also have freedom from worries.",

For, while my pappos, Kekaumenos, of blessed memory, was in Larissa, with the command of Hellas, the Bulgarian tyrant, Samuel, tried frequently, by fighting and also by treachery, to take Larissa, and was unable to. He was repelled and made fun of by (my pappos), who, on one hand, fought and defeated him, and, on the other, also propitiated him, and those around him, with gifts; and, while so doing, sowed the ground, and harvested in safety, and preserved his own people by (assuring) their self-sufficiency. But, when he saw that (Samuel) had got complete control, he acknowledged him, and, having managed him again in this way, he sowed and harvested. He also wrote to the porphyrogenitus lord Basil: 'Sacred master, I, coerced by the rebel, gave orders to the Larissans, and they acknowledged him, and sowed and harvested, with God’s help. And, for the defence of your Majesty, I have gathered crops to supply the Larissans sufficiently for four years - and see, they are your Majesty’s servants again'. When the Emperor learned of this, he approved the ruse of my pappos. clxx. After three years he appointed another general to Hellas. My pappos was not residing in Larissa, but was in the City, nor indeed was the (new) general so active in devising any tactics. When Samuel came, he did not allow them to harvest; in the seed-time he gave them freedom to sow, but in the summer he didn’t permit them to go out at all. He did this for three years, so that, when their food failed, they tried eating dogs, and asses, and some other  foul meats, and, when even they were running out, they collected skins which were lying on the garbage-heaps, cooked and ate them, wishing to assuage their hunger. Indeed, a woman, when her husband had died, even ate his thigh. From the pressure of the unbearable hunger Samuel captured them without bloodshed, and enslaved all the Larissans except for the family of Nikoulitzas. Them alone he resettled unharmed and free, and even with their possessions, saying this: ‘I am very grateful to the porphyrogenitus lord Basil, because he recalled your relation by marriage, Kekaumenos, from Hellas, and freed me from his ruses’.",

After not receiving an answer from the Emperor, of blessed memory, I (he) was grieved; and, wishing to seize the leaders of the evil plot, he reckoned like this: if he should seize them, and didn’t blind or behead them immediately, their companions would, necessarily, be in a position to rise up against him - for they had made a confederacy with the Vlachs and the people of Trikala - and perhaps they would even overcome him, and wipe him out.

He wrote to the Emperor: ‘I certainly told you, by word of mouth, that a revolt was due to take place, and I wrote to you again about this when I came to my home; and now I declare to your Serenity - at least believe me now - that they have revolted, and made me their head.

When he had encamped in front of them, on the plain below the fortress, he told them to come down to him. They all came down together, and got off their horses, and stood in front of him, in the middle of the camp, with their hands bound, saying: ‘We are your slaves, and, if you so order, we will proclaim you (emperor) now’. He said to them: ‘I know that, if I release you, and you go off, from the moment that you enter the fortress, you will not observe what you have agreed on with me, and it would be convenient for me to keep you here; but, since it is  an ancient law of warfare that the man who goes off voluntarily, either to an emperor, or to a sovereign, or a general, should not be retained by him against his will, but should go off again freely to his own, for this reason I too release you; go off cheerfully to your homes - and, if you deceive me, I will not spare you’. They made thousands of promises to him, and left. clxxix. But, after he had warned them, they went up into the fortress and began to pay insults, of the sort that boorish people habitually pay. He was grieved at their (bad) conscience, and began to besiege them, because of their insults; for he did not even want to fight them - because I (he) didn’t even undertake the revolt willingly, in order to struggle for his own acclamation, but because of the people, so that they should not be offended, and destroy him like a criminal.

Iadora and Salona are cities in Dalmatia, where a certain Dobronas was ruler and toparch, a sensible and very competent man. He once chose to go and do obeisance to the Emperor Romanos Argyros, of blessed memory, who honoured him with gifts and titles, and dismissed him to his own (home) with great wealth. So, delighted by these benefits, he did it again; and, once again, he was honoured - not as before, but sparingly - and left. After this Emperor had died, the Emperor lord Michael the Paphlagonian, of blessed memory, reigned, and again (Dobronas) came to the City; but, as he had become familiar, he was despised. When he asked to leave, he was not granted this, and was annoyed, and began to grumble. So, when the people managing the affairs of the Palace learned that he was grumbling, they reported (this) to the Emperor, and, thought up a plan like this: ‘As we have him in our hands already, let us become masters of his land, with no-one opposing us’ - which did happen. When they had shut him up in the prison of the Praetorium, they took his land  without trouble. They transported his wife and his son, and brought them to the Praetorium as well. Dobronas and his wife spent all the years of their life in prison, in the Praetorium, and died there, under the Emperor Monomachos; his son, who was despised, and considered worthless, was only just able to escape.

At (Regulus’) command the Romans killed it, and, after skinning it, he sent its skin to the senate of Rome, a great marvel. When this had been measured by the senate, as the same Dio says, it was found to have a length of one hundred and twenty feet, and its width was in proportion to its length.

The dragon is a species, like the other animals, too, and has a beard, like the goat, and, on its neck, (something) like a horn, only it isn’t hard, but is flesh, looking like horn.

For that (emperor), of blessed memory, did not have honourable parents, but he came of undistinguished parents, of very low class; but he had great virtues. Some ignorant people spread the rumour that he was well-born, and from a great stock, but he was low-born, and humble. - But I say that all men are the children of one man, Adam, both kings, and rulers, and those who seek their bread. I have seen men, snorting with pride, who turned to thefts, and divinations, and magic; these are the ones that I say are ignoble. For man, who is rational, becomes a God, if he chooses, by the grace of God. - So this is how the emperor, lord Michael, of blessed memory, was; he blossomed, as has been said, with great virtues, but he had many close relations who were poor, and who were provided for by the Orphanotrophos. This man was the Emperor's brother, who also administered the affairs of the palace. He wished to make them rich, and gave them freedom to plunder other people's things, while the Emperor knew nothing of it. But even the envoys sent out on service, and the imperial officials, wherever they met a mounted man, whether in an inn, or on uninhabited road, would throw him from his horse or his mule, seize it, and leave. And, partly because of them, but most of all through the wrongdoings of his relations, that marvellous man became hated and well-known, and everyone prayed that his family might be wiped out; and that happened not long after. For, when he had died, in peace and in a good state of repentance, and his nephew had become emperor, the whole City rose up against him, and (so did) those from outside who found themselves in (the City), having found as their pretext against him that he had exiled his aunt, the Empress. And both he and his family were wiped out in one day. Instead of him, Monomachos became emperor, who indeed ruined and made desolate the empire of the Romans. So your Mightiness must observe these things. Let the first man of your empire, who administers everything, inform you on every matter, or else a matter may come to your ears, and you don’t have knowledge of it. ",

Augustus, the son of Caesar, who was quick to anger, and harsh, and immoral, and had many blameworthy and evil inclinations, but had natural good sense, said: ‘It is not good for me (to be) without a tutor’. So he sent to Alexandria, and brought, with great honour, a certain Athenodoros, who was poor, and in need, but happened to be sensible and very intelligent; he had been described by some of the people of the Palace as great in good decisions, and intelligence. (Augustus) says to him: ‘Do you know, Athenodoros, why I have brought you here with such great honour?’ He said that he didn’t know. Then Caesar said: ‘I have inclinations contrary to my rank; and, after hearing about you that you are a good man in both decision and action, I wanted to have you as a friend and an adviser, so that, in whatever things that you see me doing or saying that are not good, and deserve censure, you may criticise me, privately; and, if I don't accept correction, do so in public, too’. Athenodoros said: ‘You too, oh mightiest, must not turn away your face when you are criticised, and despise me, and I will be your doctor in this matter’. So he did not stop criticising him, every day, until he had made perfect in virtues. When he asked to depart to his own country, he was not allowed to by Caesar (Augustus), who said to him: ‘Oh truest friend, I am still imperfect’. (Augustus) wanted to see Abgar, the Emperor of Edessa, who was most sensible and intelligent, and adorned with virtues of every kind. And, when he had seen him, and entered into conversation with him, ‘I put myself into your hands’, he said, ‘and you will be to me instead of Athenodoros’, – for Athenodoros, had come to the end of his life - and he held him in great honour, not only like a friend, but like a father, and was corrected by him for many years. This is how Augustus behaved, and was corrected by his friends, and from that time, even until now, he is celebrated for goodness.",

Certainly, if someone had confined you in one city, you would be pained and distressed at such treatment; but, since you have done this to yourself, what is there even to say? So go out into the lands which are under you, and into the themes, and see the injustices which the poor suffer, and what the agents sent by you have done, and whether the lower classes have been unjustly treated, and set everything right. The themes of the Romans, and the lands of the peoples under you will know that they have an emperor and a master watching over them, and you will know the strength of each theme and fortress and land, and how it is inclined, and in what it is injured, and in what it is helped, and no revolt will take place, nor will they rise up against the administrators, but the (lands) under you will be in a peaceful condition.

They spent their time sometimes in the East, sometimes in the West, but little of it in Byzantium. And, at that time, all the lands were peaceful; and all Europe, and Libya, and the loveliest part of Asia, as far as the Euphrates area, and the land of the Adiabeni,  Armenia together with Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine, Egypt, and the great and far-famed Babylon itself, were subject to the Romans.

He went off, and demonstrated great deeds. When Sicily had been conquered, he returned with his troops to the Emperor, and he gave him the title of lictor. After this, the revolt of Delianos took place in Bulgaria. And Harald also went on campaign with the Emperor, with his own troops, and demonstrated deeds against the enemy worthy of his nobility and valour. When the Emperor had subdued Bulgaria, he returned, I too was then exerting myself on behalf of the Emperor, to the best of my ability.
